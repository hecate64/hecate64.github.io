    As a researcher in the <a href="https://iccl.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICCL</a> lab, I&#39;ve done researches about quantizing Deep Neural Networks and DNN accelerators. Right now, I have projects on domain specific accelerators for Fully-Homomorphic-Encrypticons and Processing-In-Memory computing. </p>
    <p>I also have teaching experiences in UNIST, teaching undergraduate and first year master students to make a working example of a simple DNN Accelerator in HLS from scratch. </p>
    <p>I have chosen my major to be physics, also being interested in mathematics and physics research. 
    I have worked on large scale cosmological simulations using the data from JWST with 
    Prof. Sandro Tacchella. Additionally, I study string theory with 
    <a href="https://rakkyeongseong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Rak-Kyeong Seong</a>
    ,hoping to have publications in the future. </p>
    <p>I am currently searching for chances to enter a Ph.D. program in the US.</p>
