    As a researcher in the <a href="https://iccl.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICCL</a> lab, I have written papers about DNN HW/SW Co-Design, PIM architectures and Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption.
    I am currently working on computing systems and algorithms for FHE. The goal of my research is to revolutionize secure computing with Homomorphic Encryption.
