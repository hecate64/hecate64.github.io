As a researcher in the [ICCL](https://iccl.unist.ac.kr/) lab, I've done research about making Deep Neural Networks efficient and DNN accelerators. Right now, I have projects on domain specific accelerators for Fully-Homomorphic-Encrypticons and Processing-In-Memory computing. 


I also have teaching experiences in UNIST, teaching undergraduate and first year master students to make a working example of a simple DNN Accelerator in HLS from scratch. 


I am currently searching for chances to enter a Ph.D. program in the US.
