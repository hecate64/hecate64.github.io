As a researcher in the <a href="https://iccl.unist.ac.kr/">ICCL</a> lab, Iâ€™ve done research about making Deep Neural Networks efficient and DNN accelerators. Right now, I have projects on domain specific accelerators for Fully-Homomorphic-Encrypticons and Processing-In-Memory computing.</p>

<p>I also have teaching experiences in UNIST, teaching undergraduate and first year master students to make a working example of a simple DNN Accelerator in HLS from scratch.</p>

<p>I am currently searching for chances to enter a Ph.D. program in the US.</p>
